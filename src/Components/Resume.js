            <p>
              An internship is a professional learning experience that offers
              meaningful, practical work related to a studentâ€™s field of study
              or career interest. An internship gives a student the opportunity
              for career exploration and development, and to learn new skills.
              It offers the employer the opportunity to bring new ideas and
              energy into the workplace, develop talent and potentially build a
              pipeline for future full-time employees.
